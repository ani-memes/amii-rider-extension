# Features

This isn't a comprehensive list of all the current functionality that AMII has to offer.
Just the features that cannot be provided by the generic platform agnostic plugin.

To see a full list of features, [please see AMII's documentation](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII#documentation).

Without this extension you'll be missing out on:

### Test Result Interactions

Tests pass and tests fail, that's just a fact of life.
You know what's better than red x's and green check marks?

**Test Failures**

[comment]: <> (### Build Tasks Interactions)

[comment]: <> (This is an IDE, right? Well, that means you can build code right from your editor.)

[comment]: <> (It just so happens, that builds happen to fail from time to time.)

[comment]: <> (You did put in that semicolon, right?)

[comment]: <> (![Build Failures]&#40;./readmeAssets/build.gif&#41;)

[comment]: <> (Well MIKU knows when your builds fail too, so expect a response as well.)

[comment]: <> (**Build Pass**)

[comment]: <> (When you get your marbles all back,)

[comment]: <> (the next time you build successfully &#40;after a build failure&#41; MIKU will give you a pat on the back.)
